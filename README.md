# DLV-Coursework
Coursework for CSE 270C from Miami University

DLV stands for "Disjunctive Logic Programming with Aggregates." It's a powerful system for Answer Set Programming (ASP), which is a form of declarative programming used in artificial intelligence and logic programming. DLV is particularly well-suited for solving combinatorial optimization problems, knowledge representation, and reasoning tasks. It allows you to express complex problems in a high-level logic-based language and then automatically find solutions based on the provided constraints and rules.

DLV, which stands for Disjunctive Logic Programming with Aggregates, was created by the research group of Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Faber at the Universita della Calabria, Italy, in collaboration with researchers from the Technical University of Vienna, Austria. The development of DLV began in the mid-1990s, and it has since become one of the prominent systems for Answer Set Programming (ASP), which is a form of declarative programming used in artificial intelligence and logic programming.

I learned this during a study abroad at Universita della Calabria- from professors who were developing for DLV Version 2.1.2
